# 🚀 Secret Chat

Welcome to **Secret Chat**! This is a real-time chat application built with the power of **React** on the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend, leveraging the **Socket.io** package for seamless web-socket connections. 🎉

## 🧠 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to delve deep into the world of real-time communication by creating a chat application. This project helped me understand how websockets work and how to integrate them into a full-stack application. 📚

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naveen-g09/secret-chat.git
```

### 2. Setting Up the Backend

Navigate into the server directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd secret-chat/server
npm install
npm start
```

Your backend server should now be running. 🌐

### 3. Setting Up the Frontend

Navigate back to the root directory and then into the client directory to set up the frontend:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
```

Your frontend should now be running. 🖥️

### 4. Running the Application

Open your web browser and go to:

```plaintext
http://localhost:3000
```

To test the real-time communication, open the application in another browser window or tab, and enjoy chatting! 💬
